# To Do App

The Todo project is a user-friendly JavaScript application for managing tasks efficiently. Users can create, organize, and categorize tasks into different projects, enhancing productivity and organization.

To maintain clean and manageable code, the project follows a modular approach, separating application logic from the user interface.

Persistence is ensured through localStorage, allowing users to retain their tasks even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

The project is licensed under the MIT license, promoting collaboration and community contributions.
